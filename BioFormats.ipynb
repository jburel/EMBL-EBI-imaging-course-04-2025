    "## Bio-Formats as a conversion tool\n",
    "Often, rather than just reading an image and resaving it in a different format, it also makes sense to split the images into smaller parts, for example one might want to split a single file that contains images from a multiple-position scan into multiple individual files, where each file contains only images from a single position. Similarly, one may want to split images between different channels, time points or Z-slices. To keep track of the particular position (e.g. the well of a multiwell plate) or time point/channel/Z-slice that an image came from in the subsequent batch analysis workflow, it can be useful to embed such metadata in the filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often the conversion is done into ``.tif`` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach of splitting, converting and renaming can have some benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It allows for standardization in an image analysis workflow even in a heterogeneous facility environment with many different microscopes.\n",
    "- By using the extra step of renaming/conversion, the same pipeline/workflow can be used for images originating from different microscope systems.\n",
    "- Dealing with single large files often has performance penalties, handling smaller files can be more efficient.\n",
    "- Analysing or sharing a subset of the data is more easily done on a collection of files (this can simply be done in any file manager) rather than with a single file which can exceed hundreds of Gigabytes for a large time lapse experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common use case\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you will use ``bfconvert`` in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "bfconvert inputfile  outputfilepattern\n",
    "```\n",
    "or \n",
    "```\n",
    "bfconvert -padded inputfile  outputfilepattern\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where ``inputfile`` is the path to the input file and ``outputfilepattern`` specifies the output file path and format string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``outputfilepattern`` is not a single filename but rather a format string that defines a filename template. After all we want to split a single file into many files, so we need to specify how the many files are named. The command ``bfconvert`` replaces parts of the format string with the index number or name of the particular subset of the input file that is written to a given output file, according to the following pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   Pattern:     Metadata value:\n",
    "   ---------------------------\n",
    "   %s           series index\n",
    "   %n           series name\n",
    "   %c           channel index\n",
    "   %w           channel name\n",
    "   %z           Z index\n",
    "   %t           T index\n",
    "   %A           acquisition timestamp\n",
    "   %x           row index of the tile\n",
    "   %y           column index of the tile\n",
    "   %m           overall tile index\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given file format you may have to try out first what series and other metadata fields correspond to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for ``.lif`` files (Leica), the different series indices correspond to different positions of a multiposition scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "``-padded`` zero-padding of numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often, you will want to pass the ``-padded`` option. This makes sure that all numbers in the filename will have the same number of digits, e.g. ``1`` will be converted to ``001`` if there are more than 100 images in the series. This helps with sorting files in tools useing alphabetical sorting."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The [OME-TIFF](https://ome-model.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ome-tiff/) format was created to maximize the respective strengths of [OME-XML](https://ome-model.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ome-xml/), a file format for storing microscopy information (both pixels and metadata) using the [OME Data Model](https://ome-model.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [TIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF). It takes advantage of the rich metadata defined in OME-XML while retaining the pixels in multi-page TIFF format for compatibility with many more applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "An OME-TIFF dataset has the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image planes are stored within one multi-page TIFF file, or across multiple TIFF files. Any image organization is feasible.\n",
    "- A complete OME-XML metadata block describing the dataset is embedded in each TIFF file’s header. Thus, even if some of the TIFF files in a dataset are misplaced, the metadata remains intact.\n",
    "- The OME-XML metadata block may contain anything allowed in a standard OME-XML file.\n",
    "- OME-TIFF uses the standard TIFF mechanism for storing one or more image planes in each of the constituent files, instead of encoding pixels as base64 chunks within the XML. Since TIFF is an image format, it makes sense to only use OME-TIFF as opposed to OME-XML, when there is at least one image plane.\n",
